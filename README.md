## Description
 For this challenge I was tasked with making an employee tracker to help non devs interact and view a database. Where they can add and delete and see what's already added and visible.

## Acknowledgments
I want to acknowledge all of the people that helped me into the very late hours of the night and morning. I am glad to have peers that can peer program and catch the small sintaxis.
